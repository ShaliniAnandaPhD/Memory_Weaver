## ‚ú® What is Memory Weaver?

Memory Weaver is a revolutionary web-based platform that transforms your written memories into personalized audio experiences. By analyzing the emotions in your text, we create custom **soundscapes** - carefully crafted audio environments that combine music, ambient sounds, and psychoacoustic effects to help you relive your moments with deeper emotional resonance.

## üéß What are Soundscapes?

Soundscapes are immersive audio environments designed to evoke specific emotions and mental states. Memory Weaver creates these by layering:
- **Ambient sounds** (nature, urban, abstract)
- **Musical elements** (harmonies, rhythms, melodies)
- **Psychoacoustic effects** (binaural beats, spatial audio)
- **Emotional processing** (AI-analyzed mood enhancement)

## üöÄ Features

  - Meditation (Theta waves: 4-8 Hz)
  - Relaxation (Alpha waves: 8-14 Hz)
  - Focus (Beta waves: 14-30 Hz)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes on Audio Quality

### Web-Based Limitations
As a browser-based application, Memory Weaver faces certain audio fidelity constraints:

- **Sample Rate**: Limited to 48kHz (vs 96kHz+ in professional DAWs)
- **Bit Depth**: 16-bit processing (vs 24/32-bit in studios)
- **Latency**: Variable depending on browser and system
- **Processing Power**: Limited by browser security sandboxing

### What This Means
- ‚úÖ **Perfect for**: Personal memories, meditation, relaxation, creative exploration
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Not ideal for**: Professional music production, mastering, critical listening

### Optimization Tips
1. **Use Chrome or Firefox** for best Web Audio API support
2. **Close other tabs** to free up processing power
3. **Use headphones** for proper binaural beat effect
4. **Allow time** for audio to buffer and process

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript
- **Audio Engine**: Web Audio API
- **AI/ML**: Claude AI for emotion analysis
- **Visualization**: Three.js + Canvas
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Database**: Supabase
- **Hosting**: Lovable.app
